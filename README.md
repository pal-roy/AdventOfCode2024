**Big O notation Day 1 - Adding and sorting list pairs: **

**Reading and parsing lines:** O(n)
**Sorting list1 and list2:** 2 * O(n log n) = O(n log n)
**Calculating differences:** O(n)
**Reducing the differences:** O(n)

Conclusion: The dominant term here is O(n log n) from the sorting operations. Therefore, the overall time complexity of the program is: O(n log n)
