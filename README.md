Big O notation Day 1 - Adding and sorting list pairs: 

Reading and Parsing Lines: If there are n lines, this operation is O(n).
Sorting the Lists: Typically uses Timsort with an average and worst-case time complexity of 
List 1: O(n log n).
List 2: O(n log n).
Calculating Differences: O(n).

Conclusion: The dominant term here is O(n log n) from the sorting operations. Therefore, the overall time complexity of the program is: O(n log n)
